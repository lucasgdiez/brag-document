# brag-document
Brag Document in which I list my accomplishments throughout the year in a daily based list. 
Motivation is to keep track of my daily work on my career in which I can later reflect upon it. 
Also, avoiding the feeling of fuzziness when looking back on my previous accomplishments. 

Got inspiration from https://jvns.ca/blog/brag-documents/ and the article [Gergely Orosz wrote and mentioned it](https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/software-engineering-promotions/)

## Goal 
Keep a record of things I've done throughout the day, month, year, to have a document in which I can reflect upon it and improve myself.

## Motto 
What gets measured, gets improved.  - *Chris Do*
